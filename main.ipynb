    "Upon examining the perturbation metadata across various datasets from the scPerturb resource, several patterns emerge in the formatting of the perturbation column:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single-Gene Perturbations**: Entries often consist of a single gene name, indicating that the perturbation targets that specific gene. For example:\n",
    "   - `HLA-B`\n",
    "   - `CREBBP`\n",
    "   - `SH3RF1`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chemical or Drug Treatments**: Some entries denote chemical compounds or drugs used as perturbing agents. Examples include:\n",
    "   - `erlotinib`\n",
    "   - `panobinostat`\n",
    "   - `GNE-069`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Control Conditions**: The term `control` is used to represent baseline or unperturbed conditions across multiple datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Genomic Coordinates**: Certain perturbations are specified by genomic loci, particularly in CRISPR-based screens targeting non-coding regions. These are formatted as chromosomal coordinates, such as:\n",
    "   - `chr4:84540211-84540234`\n",
    "   - `chr1:26826520-26826543`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multi-Gene Perturbations**: Some entries list multiple genes separated by underscores or commas, indicating combined perturbations affecting several genes simultaneously. For instance:\n",
    "   - `PPP2R1A_PPCDC_MAT2A_MVK_MMAB_PMVK`\n",
    "   - `UBA1_PPP2R1A_HACD2_UQCRQ_PPCDC_FECH_UROD_RAB7A`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **CRISPR Guide Identifiers**: In datasets involving CRISPR perturbations, entries may include specific guide RNA identifiers, often prefixed with terms like `Tcrlibrary` or `ES.sg`, such as:\n",
    "   - `Tcrlibrary_JUND_2`\n",
    "   - `ES.sg35.TCEB2`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Modified Gene Names or Constructs**: Some perturbations reference modified genes or constructs, indicated by suffixes like `_pDS269` or prefixes such as `63(mod)_`, exemplified by:\n",
    "   - `CREB1_pDS269`\n",
    "   - `63(mod)_pBA580`\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns suggest that the perturbation column encapsulates a diverse range of perturbation types, each adhering to specific naming conventions pertinent to the experimental design and perturbation methodology of the respective dataset."
